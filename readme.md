# Hello there ðŸ‘‹
If you've found your way here, that means you're serious about your security and privacy! ~ or maybe just want to copy paste some code. Either way, you're welcome awesome human (beep boop?)

Thanks for checking out Cryptee's source code.
First, let's get a few things out of the way.




&nbsp;

#### Security & Issues

If you find any life threatening / critical security issues, please reach out to us using `info @ crypt [dot] ee`. You can also find our pgp public key on the website.

Otherwise, feel free to throw in your bug reports and issues here on github! The issues section is meme & emoji friendly. Please use fun GIFs. It'll cheer everyone up. This doesn't mean Cryptee isn't a serious product, it just means you can relax, smile and take things easy. We're all humans.

#### Thoughts on frameworks

99% chance, there's some of you out there, who will look at this source code and think *"WTF JQUERY!? CODEKIT!?"* or *"Y U NO ANGULAR!? WHY NOT GRUNT!?"*. That's okay. Take a deep breath, calm down.

When you are a solo-dev / entrepreneur, living frugal to launch your startup as quickly as possible, your livelihood depends on how quickly you can ship code, and are building a product that will hopefully be used by many others to gain some level of security / privacy online, one thing becomes clear:

You don't want to depend on ever-changing massive frameworks, backwards compatibility issues, or [fucking creepy licenses](https://thenextweb.com/dd/2017/09/25/facebook-re-licenses-react-mit-license-developer-backlash/).

So yeah Cryptee uses JQuery and Codekit.

(Did you feel that? All of Silicon Valley just shuddered in disgust.)
