                            Even if we receive any requests through Estonian courts or legal channels in general, to take action, the only two things we may be legally obligated to do are either to provide the encrypted data, or to retain user data. These requests will typically come from the police when they're asked to assist in a domestic or international investigations that are criminal in nature. In these rare circumstances, we may be asked to permanently retain a copy of user data to prevent the destruction of evidence in an ongoing criminal investigation. However for these requests, the data is only retained, and is not handed over to any third parties.

                            Cryptee is based in Estonia, Europe.  
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>The US government can not ask, compel or force Cryptee —an Estonian and European company— to release or give up your data.</strong>
                            <br><br>
                            In Estonia, in Europe, your freedoms, rights, integrity and bodily-autonomy come first. 
                            <br><br>
                            — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Estonia" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="external">Abortion in Estonia has been legal since 23 November 1955. — 20 more years ago than Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973)</a>
                            <br><br>
                            — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Estonia" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="external">Estonia allows abortion on-demand for any purpose.</a>
                            <br><br>
                            — In addition, 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaja_Kallas" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="external">at the time of this writing in Estonia, we have a young, female prime minister.</a>
                            <br><br>
                            Finally, let's talk about why mathematically your data is safe with Cryptee. 
                            <br><br>
                            On Cryptee, your files, photos or videos never leave your device unencrypted. We can't see the contents of your files, photos or videos. Only you can. 
                            <br><br>
                            So even if we were hypothetically forced to give up your data at gunpoint, the limited data we would be able to provide is encrypted using AES-256. An encryption so strong, that it would take a dedicated supercomputer millions of years to crack open the encryption and take a look at your data.

                        <span itemprop="text">
                            On Cryptee, your files, photos and videos are encrypted on the client-side, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_encryption" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="external">client-side encryption</a>, at all times using AES-256, with user's encryption keys, which we do not have access to.
                            <br><br>
                            This means that our APIs only carry data that which is encrypted on the client-side.
                            <br><br>
                            If we were to open up our APIs for third party development, all encryption would need to be done by third party developers, and our users would need to provide their keys to these third party developers. 
                            <br><br>
                            So that's a big bold <strong>NO</strong> from us.

                            But at the moment, our backend code is not open sourced or available for public due to multiple reasons:
                            <br><br>
                            1) The main reason why Cryptee, and most other privacy-first companies are hesitant about open sourcing their backend is because it risks exposing the tightly integrated abuse-prevention systems. Opening our backend code could quickly lead to all sorts of sign-up abuse, which isn't sustainable for a small company / startup like Cryptee. (financially or technically)
                            <br><br>
                            2) There really isn't a trust benefit to open sourcing any backend code. Because:
                            <br><br>
                            2a) It isn't possible to verify the code that is actually running on the backend.
                            <br><br>
                            2b) This is also the reason why all the encryption happens on the front-end. So that you don't have to trust black-box servers running unverifiable code. Once you read the front-end source code, you can verify that your data never leaves your device unencrypted.
                            <br><br>
                            Every now and then we get requests to open source our backend code so that some users can run it on their own servers. Cryptee is a project built for everyone to have a secure home for their files. And the largest majority of the internet users aren't tech-savvy, they can't (and shouldn't have to) set up their own servers, and perhaps don't even know the meaning of the word "backend" (and shouldn't have to). But they need a secure and private place for their files and digital belongings. Spending time towards open sourcing our backend and doing so in a way that it can work on any given server is a massive undertaking, and with the very limited resources Cryptee has at the moment, this is an unsustainable approach for business, growth and development.

                            Cryptee uses Codekit and JQuery. <i>zepto ... if we're being specific.</i>
                            Chances are some of you will look at this source code and think "WTF JQUERY!? CODEKIT!?" or "Y U NO ANGULAR!? WHY NOT REACT? NO GRUNT!?". That's okay. Take a deep breath, calm down.
                            <br><br>
                            When you are a small company competing with giants, your only advantage is to ship code as reliably —yet as quickly— as possible, when your livelihood depends on how quickly you can ship new features, and building a product that is used by hundreds of thousands of users every day to gain some level of security / privacy online, one thing becomes clear:
                            <br><br>
                            You don't want to depend on ever-changing massive frameworks, backwards compatibility issues, or <a href="https://thenextweb.com/dd/2017/09/25/facebook-re-licenses-react-mit-license-developer-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="external">fucking creepy licenses</a>.
                            <br><br>
                            So yeah Cryptee uses Codekit and JQuery/Zepto. Deal with it.
