                    <strong>parting</strong><br><br>
                    There's no use in weeping,<br>
                    Though we are condemned to part:<br>
                    There's such a thing as keeping<br>
                    A remembrance in one's heart:<br>
                    <br>
                    There's such a thing as dwelling<br>
                    On the thought ourselves have nurs'd,<br>
                    And with scorn and courage telling<br>
                    The world to do its worst.<br>
                    <br>
                    We'll not let its follies grieve us,<br>
                    We'll just take them as they come;<br>
                    And then every day will leave us<br>
                    A merry laugh for home.<br>
                    <br>
                    When we've left each friend and brother,<br>
                    When we're parted wide and far,<br>
                    We will think of one another,<br>
                    As even better than we are.<br>
                    <br>
                    Every glorious sight above us,<br>
                    Every pleasant sight beneath,<br>
                    We'll connect with those that love us,<br>
                    Whom we truly love till death !<br>
                    <br>
                    In the evening, when we're sitting<br>
                    By the fire perchance alone,<br>
                    Then shall heart with warm heart meeting,<br>
                    Give responsive tone for tone.<br>
                    <br>
                    We can burst the bonds which chain us,<br>
                    Which cold human hands have wrought,<br>
                    And where none shall dare restrain us<br>
                    We can meet again, in thought.<br>
                    <br>
                    So there's no use in weeping,<br>
                    Bear a cheerful spirit still;<br>
                    Never doubt that Fate is keeping<br>
                    Future good for present ill !<br>
                </p>
