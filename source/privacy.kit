                    We collect as little user information as possible. Only the absolute bare minimum stuff to still be able to provide a service to you. All your personal data is encrypted, but in order to provide a service, we still need a few bits of other data. Let's begin.

                <p>
                    We have an analytics system. We didn't trust any third party ones. So we built one ourselves instead. It is 100% anonymous, and it's only there just to see how well we're doing with design, improvements, features and page views.
                </p>

                <p>We do not require ANY personal information. You don't even need to use an email. It's only for convenience. <br><br> Oh, and, legally we have to record the date and time of your sign up.</p>

                <p><strong>Account activity</strong></p>

                    <strong>Payment Information</strong>
                    <br><br>

                    The Company relies on third parties to process payments, so the Company necessarily must share your user identification number with the payment processor to be able to know which account the payment will be applied to. We do not otherwise store any of your payment information.
                    Payments of users signed up after February 21, 2021 are processed by Stripe.com, 1 Grand Canal Street Lower, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin, and the merchant of record is The Company.
                    Payments of users signed up before February 21, 2021 are processed by Paddle.com, Market Ltd, 15 Bermondsey Square, SE1 3UN London, United Kingdom, as merchant of record.

                    As the payment process is entirely and independently carried out by Stripe.com or Paddle.com, you submit the relevant payment data, especially your payment details and your email address, directly to Stripe.com or Paddle.com. 
                    You can find their Privacy Policy at <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">stripe.com/privacy</a> and <a href="https://paddle.com/legal">paddle.com/legal</a>. 

                    In order to comply with credit card processing requirements, the Service includes third-party javascript from Stripe that may contain other tracking. However, this content is only loaded on the payment page.

                    The use of your data by Paddle.com is based on Art. 6 subpara. 1 point b of GDPR. Furthermore, Paddle.com allows the Company to access the following payment data: Your email address, your payment method (e.g. by credit card), but not the payment details itself, in order to obtain an overview over the Service's performance. 
                    This use is based on Art. 6 subpara. 1 point of GDPR, while the legitimate interest of Paddle.com is to transparently communicate its sales of the Service to the Company; the legitimate interest of the Service is to know about its revenues generated by Paddle.com. 
                    The user, data subject has the possibility to revoke consent for the handling of personal data at any time from Paddle. A revocation shall not have any effect on personal data which must be processed, used or transmitted in accordance with (contractual) payment processing.

                    We do not use any cookies in the Service. (nor any advertising tracking cookies, nor any other form of tracking cookies or user tracking system in general)<br><br>

                    Only pieces of identifiers stored on the user's device locally are stored either in indexedDB, localStorage or sessionStorage, employed to authenticate, identify and secure users while using the service.<br><br>
                    
                    These locally stored pieces of identifiers are used only to prevent abuse, authenticate and remember the user while the user is actively using the Service and navigating between pages. All locally stored information is flushed clean once the user signs out.<br><br>
                    
                    To further improve security, encryption/decryption keys are only stored in memory and flushed once the page is reloaded, even if the user is not signed out. Therefore even if a user is not signed out, their files would be encrypted and inaccessible without re-entering this key after reloading the page or navigating away from it.<br><br>
                                                            
                    We also have a script that regularly deletes all cookies on each page load. This is used as an additional measure to ensure none of our providers can start adding unsolicited cookies in the future.<br><br>
